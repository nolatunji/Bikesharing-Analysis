# Bikesharing

## Overview
For this project, data from the Citi Bike program in New York City was used. The purpose of the project is to analyze the data from New York City's bike sharing program to see if it would be a viable business model in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis focuses on using the NYC data to answer key questions as a starting point for launching this business investment idea. For this analysis a sample of data was used from the month of August since it would be one of the busiest times for the bike share program.

## Results 

This chart displays the duration of the average trip and how many bikes are in use during these trips. The average trip is usually around 30 minutes with few, if any trips lasting longer than 1 hour.

From looking at the trip duration data another feature of the data that may be important would be the gender of the customers who are renting the bikes. This chart displays the same data as the previous chart but divided by gender. From this chart we can see that men comprise the majority of customers who are using the Citibike program.

To further understand the trends of customers in NYC the heatmap below shows the most active times on the bike sharing platform across the week. The busiest times based on the chart are during the moring commute Monday - Friday from 7am to 9am, and during the afternoon commute Monday - Friday 4pm to 6pm.

Similar to the data that was displayed in the earlier chart, during those busiest commute times, the majority of the customers are males as can be seen in the heatmap below.

The bike share customer base has been divided into two segments in this graph, customers and subscribers. The customers are users of the platform who do not have an active subscription with Citibike, while the subscribers do. The heatmap shows a large portion of the the customer base are those who have subscriptions. The chart also shows that customers with subscriptions are most active during the weekdays with a drop in volume on the weekends, while customers without subscriptions show an increase in usage during the weekends.

This map shows the most active starting points for Citibike rentals in New York City. The largest concentration of popular starting points is in lower Manhattan. This could be due to traffic, or other factors that make commuting in the area by other forms of transportation difficult. Also there may more tourist activity in the area as well.

With our data showing us that the majority of trips last approximately 30 minutes, the heatmap below showing the most popular ending points for bike share customers supports that data. The concentration of most popular ending points is in the same area as the most popular starting points indicating that the riders are not taking bikes across longer distances.

## Summary 

The New York City Citibike analysis has provided key insights into the customer base and usage of the platform in a big metropolitan city such as New York. The main points revealed by the analysis are the majority of the users of the platform are male customers who have subscriptions and are most active on the weekdays especially during peak rush hour commute times. 

### Further Analysis
Continued analysis of the data could be useful in the decision making process for investors. Potential future exploration of the data could include: 

- analysis of usage on the weekends to get more detailed information on which segments of the customer base (age, gender, customer type, etc.)  are using the service on the weekends.  
- analysis of where the customer base is most active on the weekends using the map overlays for the most popular rental sites during those times.
