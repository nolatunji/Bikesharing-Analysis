# Bikesharing

## Overview
For this project, I used data from the Citi Bike program in New York City. The purpsoe of the project is to analyze the data from New York City's bike sharing program to see if it would be viable business model in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis focuses on using the NYC data to answer key questions as a starting point for deciding on going forward with this business investment idea.

## Results 

This chart displays the duration of the average trip and how many bikes are in use during these trips. The average trip is usually around 30 minutes with few trips lasting longer than 1 hour.

From looking at the trip duration data another feature of the data that may be important would be the gender of the customers who are renting the bikes. This chart displays the same data as the previous chart but divided by gender. From this chart we can see that men comprise the majority of customers who are using the Citibike program.
